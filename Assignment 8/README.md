Image Classification

You are given a 3 data corpus of labeled images. The labels identify the handwritten Azerbaijani letters‚Äù. 

1.	Train data: HandChars_150_Train.txt
Test Data: HandChars_50_Test.txt

Features(pixel) in these files have different lengths. You should bring them to same length as PA-7.

2.	Train Data: HandChars32_150_Train.txt
Test Data: HandChars32_50_Test.txt

Images in these files have same size: 32*32.

3.	Train Data: HandChars_FeatExt_PDC4428_150_Train.txt
Test Data: HandChars_FeatExt_PDC4428_50_Test.txt

In this data, Image features were calculated by PDC algorithm.

Tasks: 
- Apply Fully connected Neural Networks to all 3 datasets. (30%)
- Apply Convolutional Neural Networks to all 3 datasets  (50%)
- Comparison. Write a report which algorithm is best for your data and clarify your decision (20%)
- Extra task: Train your model on pre-trained models by Transfer learning and explain how does is affects to train process (20%).
