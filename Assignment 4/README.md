In this programming homework, you will apply supervised machine learning algorithms such as Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Decision Tree to specific DataSet (data4.rar) using scikit learn python library.



Data structure:



Label # features



(0# -2.82946007818682; -1.74880112063902; â€¦.)



There are numbers before "#" indicate indexes of labels,



and numbers after "#" indicate values of features.      



Homework is divided in several parts:



Load Data (10 %).



Train model by supervised machine learning algorithms on Train DataSet, then tune parameters based on Cross Validation DataSet, then evaluate the models through Test DataSet.



Models:



Neural Networks (30%).
Support Vector Machines (30%)
Decision Tree (30 %)
