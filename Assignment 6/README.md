You are given a data corpus (azeri_news.xlsx) of labeled Azerbaijani news articles. The labels identify the category of a given news article such as “dünya”, “idman”, “İqtisadiyyat”, “maraqlı”, “mədəniyyət”, “siyasət”.

Tasks:

- Extract features from news documents using TF-IDF method (10%)
- Randomly split dataset into train and test sets. (40%)
  + Train SVM machine learning model.
  + Train A multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network
  + Train Decision Tree algorithm
- Try to increase the accuracy by using hyperparameter tuning (20%)
- Evaluate the performance of the model on the test set (10%):
  + Find the accuracy, Precision, Recall of the model
  + Construct confusion matrix
- Comparison. Write a report which algorithm is best for your data and clarify your decision (20%)
